# ‚è© Snap Kitchen Slider

_During an interview with [Snap Kitchen][1], I was asked to code a slider from their marketing site. So I fired up [CodeSandbox][2] and got to work. This exercise was particularly challenging because I had never created a slider before, but especially enjoyable beacuse I was working in an environment I was comfortable with._

## ‚ùì Question

Recreate the meal slider from the home page of [Snap Kitchen][1].

## ü§î Assumptions

No assumptions needed to be made, the question was crystal clear, although challenging to accomplish in the allotted time.

However, because I implemented this complete solution after the interview, I actually created somethign with more functionality than what was on [Snap Kitchen's][1] website. I implemented previous and next buttons that go into a disabled state if the slider is on the first or last element.

## üíÄ Execution

If you want to see my solution, clone the repository and execute it locally!

```
git clone https://github.com/bradgarropy/snap-kitchen-slider.git
cd snap-kitchen-slider
npm install
npm start
```
